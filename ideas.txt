structs are anologous to C structs. packing and allignment included

for packed and alligned structs use syntax like struct(packed, allign(4)) { ... }
    this way keywords are conditional

classes are allowed to reorganize members for proper packing

long cast with :: for statements like a = int:: b + c
    or maybe just have a cast assign a := b + c

tuples, being basically dynamically allocated structs
