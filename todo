static members in structs/classes

constant global arrays (int[] i = [1,2,3,4])

delete, etc should accept qualified identifiers (eg .blocks)
array 'new' should accept variable length. eg (int[] arr = new int[5 * i])

SDL_BlitSurface doesn't seem to work. (DEFINE macro?)

set member class types and arrays to zero

".vy -= 0.1" error. (values must be same type)

casting of +=, -=

error if member lookup fails (eg .x, but x not in this)

//cannot call function on returned struct eg (getStruct().doStuff()) where the prototype is "MyStruct GetStruct()"

'struct = Struct()' expression is still a bit silly

new Class() sometimes does not work if Class is declared after use

'or' statement does not have short-circuit
