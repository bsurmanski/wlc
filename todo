static members in structs/classes

set member class types and arrays to zero

? recursive types (types that contain references to each other) crash things

rearange class members largest to smallest (for packing efficiency)

warn of invalid use of local if function member

functions accept extra parameters (which are then ignored)

allocating class on stack does not set vtable

"[int, int]^ tup; tup++" breaks things (eg, passing tuple by reference)

unions do not take into account class lifetime

check for index void^

select tuple constant type dependant on context (eg [int, int] instead of [long, long] if needed)
    (problem noticed in function call parameter)

make function arguments const
